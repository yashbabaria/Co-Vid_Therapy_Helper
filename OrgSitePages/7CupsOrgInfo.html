        Connect with a listener by requesting the first available listener, or by selecting a specific listener from our community.

        All of our listeners have completed our Active Listening training program, an online course in advanced skills for compassionate communication.
        The course is designed by our psychologist in residence, Glen Moriarty (who also happens to be our CEO & Founder).

        Many of our listeners have joined 7 Cups of Tea because they love to help others and want to do something meaningful in their free time.
        All our listeners offer their kind ear for free since they understand what it is like to feel alone in distress.
